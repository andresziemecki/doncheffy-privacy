  <h2>1. Information collected</h2>

  <h3>1.1 Information you provide</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Email address (used for account creation, authentication via email/password, and support).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>1.2 Photos and camera</h3>
  <p>
    The App may request access to your device camera to allow you to take pictures.
    Pictures you choose to upload are stored securely using <strong>Firebase Storage</strong>.
    You can control camera permissions at any time in your device settings.
  </p>

  <h3>1.3 Analytics and diagnostics</h3>
  <p>
    The App uses <strong>Firebase Analytics</strong> to understand how features are used and
    <strong>Firebase Crashlytics</strong> to identify and fix technical issues.
    These services collect technical information related to your device and app usage,
    such as app interactions and crash data.
  </p>

  <h2>2. How information is used</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To provide and operate the App and its features</li>
    <li>To authenticate users and manage accounts</li>

    <li>Apple App Store In-App Purchases</li>
    <li>Google Play In-App Purchases</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Payments are processed directly by Apple or Google. I do not receive or store your full
    payment card details. I may receive purchase and subscription status information required
    to enable paid features.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Data sharing</h2>
  <p>
    Personal data is not sold. Data may be shared only with service providers necessary to
    operate the App (such as Firebase) or when required by law.

    Personal data is retained only for as long as necessary to provide the App and comply with
    legal obligations.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Your rights (GDPR & Switzerland)</h2>
