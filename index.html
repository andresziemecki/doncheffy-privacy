    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="meta">
      For the <strong>Don Cheffy</strong> mobile app (iOS &amp; Android)<br />
      Last updated: <strong>January 5, 2026</strong>

    <div class="card">
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Don Cheffy</strong> (“<strong>I</strong>”, “<strong>me</strong>”, “<strong>my</strong>”) collects, uses,
        and shares information when you use the Don Cheffy mobile application (the “<strong>App</strong>”).
      </p>
      <p class="meta">
        Controller (GDPR): <strong>Individual developer</strong>, Switzerland<br />
        Contact: <a href="mailto:support@doncheffy.com">support@doncheffy.com</a>
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>1) Scope</h2>
    <p>
      This policy applies to the <strong>Don Cheffy</strong> <strong>mobile app</strong>. It covers information collected
      through the App, including when you create an account, use app features, and make in-app purchases.
    </p>

    <h2>2) Information I collect</h2>
    <h3>2.1 Information you provide</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Email address</strong> (for account creation, login, and support).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2 Information from your device (permissions)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Camera / Photos (Pictures)</strong>: If you choose to take or upload photos in the App, the App will request access
        to your camera and/or photo library (depending on your device settings). You can deny or revoke access in your device settings.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.3 Analytics and app performance data</h3>
    <p>
      I use <strong>Firebase</strong> (Google) to understand app usage and improve stability (for example, analytics and/or crash reporting).
      Firebase may collect information such as device identifiers, app interactions, approximate location derived from IP (depending on configuration),
      and performance data. The exact data depends on which Firebase features are enabled in the App.
    </p>

    <h2>3) How I use your information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To provide and operate the App (account access, core features).</li>
      <li>To communicate with you (support responses, important service messages).</li>
      <li>To improve the App (analytics, troubleshooting, performance monitoring).</li>
      <li>To protect the App and users (security, fraud prevention, abuse detection).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4) Payments and purchases</h2>
    <p>
      The App offers paid products/services via:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Apple In-App Purchases</strong> (iOS)</li>
      <li><strong>Google Play In-App Billing</strong> (Android)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>I do not receive your full payment card details.</strong> Payment processing is handled by Apple or Google.
      I may receive purchase-related information such as subscription status, product identifiers, and transaction/receipt metadata
      needed to provide access to paid features.
    </p>

    <h2>5) Sharing of information</h2>
    <p>
      I do not sell your personal information. I may share information only as needed:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Service providers</strong> that help operate the App (e.g., Firebase). They process data on my behalf under their terms and policies.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Legal and safety</strong>: if required by law, regulation, legal process, or to protect rights, safety, and security.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Business changes</strong>: if the App is involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, user information may be transferred as part of that transaction.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6) Data retention</h2>
    <p>
      I keep personal information only for as long as needed to provide the App and for legitimate purposes such as compliance,
      resolving disputes, enforcing agreements, and improving the App.
    </p>

    <h2>7) Your choices and controls</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Camera/Photos permission</strong>: You can allow or deny access in your device settings at any time.</li>
      <li><strong>Analytics</strong>: Depending on your device and Firebase configuration, you may be able to limit ad tracking and certain identifiers in device settings.</li>
      <li><strong>Account</strong>: You can contact me to request access, correction, or deletion of your data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8) GDPR (EEA/UK/Switzerland-aligned privacy rights)</h2>
    <p>
      If you are in the EEA/UK/Switzerland, you have rights under applicable data protection laws (including GDPR-style rights), such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Access</strong>: request a copy of your personal data.</li>
      <li><strong>Rectification</strong>: request correction of inaccurate or incomplete data.</li>
      <li><strong>Erasure</strong>: request deletion of your personal data (when legally applicable).</li>
      <li><strong>Restriction</strong>: request restriction of processing in certain cases.</li>
      <li><strong>Portability</strong>: request transfer of your data to you or another provider (where applicable).</li>
      <li><strong>Objection</strong>: object to certain processing based on legitimate interests.</li>
      <li><strong>Withdraw consent</strong>: where processing is based on consent, you can withdraw it at any time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Lawful bases for processing</h3>
    <p>
      I process personal data under one or more of these lawful bases (as applicable):
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Contract</strong>: to provide the App and features you request (e.g., account access, paid features).</li>
      <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong>: to improve and secure the App, understand usage trends, and prevent abuse (balanced against your rights).</li>
      <li><strong>Consent</strong>: for certain device permissions (e.g., camera/photos) and where required by law.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal obligation</strong>: to comply with applicable laws and regulations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to exercise your GDPR rights</h3>
    <p>
      Email me at <a href="mailto:support@doncheffy.com">support@doncheffy.com</a> with your request. For security, I may ask you to verify account ownership.
      You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection authority in your country or region.
    </p>

    <h2>9) International transfers</h2>
    <p>
      Some service providers (such as Firebase/Google) may process data on servers outside Switzerland/EEA/UK. Where required,
      appropriate safeguards are used (for example, standard contractual clauses or other lawful transfer mechanisms).
    </p>

    <h2>10) Children’s privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The App is not intended for children under 13, and I do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
      If you believe a child has provided personal information, contact me and I will take steps to delete it.
    </p>

    <h2>11) Security</h2>
    <p>
      I use reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational measures to protect information. However, no method of transmission
      or storage is 100% secure, so I cannot guarantee absolute security.
    </p>

    <h2>12) Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The updated version will be posted on this page with a new “Last updated” date.
    </p>
